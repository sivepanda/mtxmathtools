# mtxmathtools 
## Introduction
This project aims to make my life easier when I am computing matrix stuff using Sympy for Math 218 D-1 at Duke University. It's currently just a wrapper for Sympy, but there is a chance I make it more fancy in the future.

It's mostly designed to make sense for me, but I imagine it can be helpful for other people as well. Make a pull request or comment if you have ideas.


# Usage
Usage is fairly simple, as the program is designed to be a python library. To run, all you need to do is install the library with `pip install .` in the main directory in the project. This will install dependencies as well. Then, you can run `mtxmathtools`.
